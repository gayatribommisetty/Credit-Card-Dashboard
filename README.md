## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive **Credit Card Weekly Dashboard** using Power BI to provide actionable insights into key performance metrics. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding credit card operations, revenue generation, and customer behavior.



## Objective
To create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard that tracks credit card revenue, transactions, and customer segmentation, helping stakeholders understand trends and optimize strategies effectively.



## Features
1. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Provides insights into revenue, interest earned, transaction volume, and customer contributions.
   - Includes filter options for week numbers, card types, and customer demographics.

2. **Data Segmentation**:
   - Revenue segmented by:
     - Age group
     - Income level
     - Geography (state-level analysis)
     - Spending categories (bills, entertainment, fuel, grocery, etc.)
     - Card type (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum)
     - Job type (businessman, white-collar, self-employed, etc.)

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Week-over-week (WoW) and year-to-date (YTD) comparisons.
   - Operational metrics like activation rate and delinquency rate.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Charts and graphs showcasing trends in revenue, transactions, and customer contributions.
   - Geographical insights identifying high-revenue states.



## Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
- **Power BI**: Interactive visualization and dashboard creation.
- **DAX**: Calculation of measures and columns for advanced insights.
